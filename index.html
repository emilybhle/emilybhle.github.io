            <p>Hello and welcome! My name is Emily L&ecirc; and I am a visual storyteller. My strengths lie within video production and visual design, but I consider myself a "jack-of-all-trades" when it comes to the digital world, with heavy practice in graphic design, web design, and photography.</p>
            <p>I am an alum of the beautiful Colorado State University and pride myself with the skills and lessons I learned during my time as a Ram. Throughout my time at CSU I was able to work with some wonderful organizations and companies like Comedy Works, United Way of Larimer County, and the Walt Disney Company.</p>
            <p>I am not just a person behind a lens or in front of a screen but also someone who values my community and being around others that inspire me. I love being involved and sharing stories with others. I hope to continue on this journey we call "life" by finding people to surround myself with that will also share my core values of resilience, authenticity, and finding the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
            <p>Please take a look around this website to learn more about what I can do for you!</p>
